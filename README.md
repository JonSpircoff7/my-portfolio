# My Portfolio

My Portfolio is a culmination of all of my work that will occur during the UCF bootcamp course over three months. As I progress through these stages of development in the course, I will further update the links and applications of this website.


## Installation

```bash
N/a

## Usage

```python
The website allows you to use navigational links to move to the areas of content in the application. There are also links embedded in the photos located in the work section as well as contact links that will redirect you to the websites associated. 
```
